  This is a simple site I will use for cool experiments with web technologies. Anything cool I find on the web
  or make myself I put here. Most of the things here will be expanded on one day when I find some time.

  This website uses middleman for static site generation, so everything should be pretty fast and the website should
  work without javascript
